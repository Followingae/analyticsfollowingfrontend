# üö® CRITICAL BACKEND PERFORMANCE ISSUES - INVESTIGATION REQUIRED

## Issue Summary
Authentication endpoints are experiencing severe performance degradation causing 30-60+ second response times and registration success/failure detection issues.

## üî• Critical Issues

### 1. LOGIN ENDPOINT PERFORMANCE
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
**Status:** CRITICAL - 57+ seconds response time

**Performance Test Results:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpassword"}'
```

**Timeline:**
- 0-10s: Request sent, backend receives data
- 10-30s: No response, request hanging
- 30-57s: Still no HTTP status code returned  
- 57+s: Request interrupted (still no response)

**Impact:** Users cannot log in - complete authentication failure

### 2. REGISTRATION ENDPOINT PERFORMANCE  
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
**Status:** CRITICAL - Similar timeout issues

**Performance Test Results:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"testuser@gmail.com","password":"testpassword123","full_name":"Test User"}'
```

**Timeline:**
- 0-11s: Request processing
- 11s: Connection reset by peer (curl: Recv failure)

**Impact:** Registration succeeds on backend (user created in Supabase) but frontend shows failure

### 3. RESPONSE FORMAT MISMATCH
**Issue:** Frontend expects `access_token` field but may be receiving different format
**Evidence:** User created successfully in Supabase but frontend registration fails

## üîç Areas for Backend Investigation

### Database Performance
- [ ] Check user table query performance
- [ ] Monitor database connection pooling
- [ ] Look for table locks during auth operations
- [ ] Review database indexes on user table

### Authentication Processing
- [ ] Password hashing performance (bcrypt/scrypt)
- [ ] JWT token generation time
- [ ] Supabase Auth integration latency
- [ ] Token signing/verification performance

### Server Performance
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in auth service
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage during auth requests
- [ ] Review request timeout configurations
- [ ] Check for blocking operations in auth flow

### Response Format
- [ ] Verify registration endpoint returns expected format:
  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "jwt_token_here",
    "refresh_token": "refresh_token_here", 
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 1800,
    "user": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "full_name": "User Name",
      "role": "free"
    }
  }
  ```

## üìä Expected Performance Benchmarks
- **Login:** < 2 seconds
- **Registration:** < 3 seconds  
- **Current Performance:** 30-60+ seconds (unacceptable)

## üîß Frontend Mitigations Applied
1. Increased request timeout to 45 seconds
2. Enhanced error handling for long requests
3. Added comprehensive response format detection
4. Improved logging for debugging

## üìù Logs to Collect
When testing, collect these logs:
1. Backend server logs during auth requests
2. Database query execution times
3. Supabase Auth API response times
4. Memory/CPU usage during auth operations

## ‚ö° Immediate Actions Required
1. **URGENT:** Fix authentication endpoint performance (goal: <2s response)
2. Verify registration response format matches frontend expectations
3. Add backend performance monitoring for auth endpoints
4. Test with multiple concurrent auth requests

## üì± User Impact
- **Current State:** Authentication system unusable
- **User Experience:** 30-60 second waits followed by failures
- **Business Impact:** New users cannot register, existing users cannot login
